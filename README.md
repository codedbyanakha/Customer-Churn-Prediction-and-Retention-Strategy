# Customer-Churn-Prediction-and-Retention-Strategy
Predict customer churn using machine learning, identify key churn drivers, and provide actionable retention strategies. Helps businesses target high-risk customers, reduce churn, and improve loyalty through data-driven insights.Aims to analyze customer behavior, predict churn probability, and design effective retention strategies using data-driven insights. By leveraging machine learning models and visualization techniques, it helps businesses identify customers at risk of leaving and take proactive measures to improve retention.
Analyzes customer data to predict churn probability and develop effective retention strategies. The project applies techniques like EDA, feature engineering, SMOTE for class balancing, and models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to identify at-risk customers and provide actionable insights to improve customer retention, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is applied for model interpretability, highlighting key features driving churn.

Objectives
1. Identify key factors contributing to customer churn.
2. Build predictive models to estimate churn likelihood.
3. Handle class imbalance effectively using SMOTE.
4. Use clustering to segment customers based on behavior.
5. Interpret model predictions using SHAP values for actionable insights.
6. Suggest actionable retention strategies for high-risk customers.

Key Steps
1. Data Collection & Cleaning – Import, inspect, and preprocess the dataset.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identify patterns, correlations, and key churn indicators.
3. Feature Encoding & Scaling – Prepare data for modeling using LabelEncoder and StandardScaler.
4. Model Building – Train models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
5. Model Evaluation – Evaluate models using accuracy, recall, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices.
6. Model Interpretability – Use SHAP to explain feature contributions for churn predictions.
7. Retention Strategy – Propose targeted actions for each high-risk customer.

Results
1. Improved churn prediction accuracy using ensemble methods.
2. Identified top features influencing churn.
3. Interpreted model predictions using SHAP values
4. Developed actionable retention recommendations based on data insights and clustering results.
